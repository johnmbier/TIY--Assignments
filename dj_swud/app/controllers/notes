What does it do?
the has one button. Once that button is pushed, the user will
see a randomly generated "DJ Name". and possibly a definition.

Example: DJ Darth Facepalm

The name will consist of 2 components: 
1. a first name from the Swapi(star wars api), randomly chosen.
   - only the first name should be returned. 

2. a randomly generated word from the Urban Dictionary api.

both api's will randomly choose the 2 components that make up the returned
"DJ Name".

3. the associated definition from the urb. dic api would be a nice addition.
